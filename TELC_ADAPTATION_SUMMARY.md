## Implementation Plan for You

### Option 1: Quick Critical Updates (2-3 hours)
Focus only on content that appears in the exam:
1. Update exam overview (✅ Done!)
2. Update Week 1, Day 1 lesson content
3. Rewrite Week 2, Day 3 (Writing)
4. Insert Sprachbausteine lesson
5. Update speaking terminology

**Result:** Core telc-specific content is correct, you can study effectively

### Option 2: Complete Adaptation (5-8 hours)
Do everything in the priority list:
- All critical updates (above)
- Time reference updates throughout
- Resource link updates
- Remove/mark optional content that's not in telc
- Review and update all examples

**Result:** App is fully adapted to telc B1

### Option 3: Gradual Updates
- Do critical updates now (before starting Week 1)
- Update each week's content the day before you study it
- Complete in 12 weeks as you progress

**Result:** Spread the work over time, update as you need it

## My Recommendation

**For your January 8 exam date, I recommend Option 1 + Gradual:**

1. **Today (Dec):** Do critical updates (2-3 hours)
   - Week 1 Day 1 content
   - Week 2 Day 3 writing
   - Insert Sprachbausteine
   - Speaking terminology

2. **As you progress:** Update each week before studying it
   - Week 1: Update remaining resources
   - Week 2: Ensure Sprachbausteine is integrated
   - Week 3: Clean up forum writing lesson
   - Etc.

This gets you accurate study material immediately while spreading the remaining work.
