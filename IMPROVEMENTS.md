# German B1 Learning Tracker - Recent Improvements

## Date: October 26, 2025

### üêõ Bug Fixes

#### 1. Fixed Input Field Cursor Jumping Issue
**Problem**: When typing in the notes textarea field, the cursor would jump to the beginning after each keystroke, making it impossible to edit.

**Solution**: 
- Wrapped the `updateNotes` function with `useCallback` hook to memoize the function
- This prevents the component from recreating the function on every render
- The textarea now maintains cursor position correctly during editing

**Code Change**:
```javascript
// Before
const updateNotes = (weekNum, dayNum, notes) => { ... }

// After
const updateNotes = useCallback((weekNum, dayNum, notes) => { ... }, []);
```
