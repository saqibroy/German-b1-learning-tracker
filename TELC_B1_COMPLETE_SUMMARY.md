## 🔴 TOP 3 PRIORITIES

### 1. **Sprachbausteine** (HIGHEST PRIORITY!)
**Why:** This section doesn't exist in Goethe, so it's completely new for you!

**What it is:**
- Teil 1: 10 multiple-choice grammar questions (articles, cases, prepositions, conjunctions)
- Teil 2: 10 vocabulary matching questions (collocations, fixed phrases)

**How to practice:**
- Your telc PDF has practice questions (pages 12-13)
- Search online: "telc B1 Sprachbausteine Übungen"
- Practice daily (15-20 minutes)
- Make flashcards for:
  - Always-Accusative prepositions (durch, für, gegen, ohne, um)
  - Always-Dative prepositions (aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu)
  - Common verb+preposition combos (warten auf, denken an, sich freuen auf)

### 2. **Writing ONE Email** (HIGH PRIORITY!)
**Why:** Format is completely different from what you're learning now!

**What changed:**
- OLD: 60 minutes, 3 separate tasks (email, forum post, formal letter)
- NEW: 30 minutes, 1 email/letter addressing 4 Leitpunkte

**How to practice:**
- Use writing task from your PDF (page 17)
- ALWAYS time yourself (30 minutes!)
- ALWAYS address all 4 Leitpunkte
- Practice both informal (du) and semi-formal (Sie)
- Target length: 120-150 words

**Key phrases to memorize:**
- **Informal opening:** Liebe/Lieber [Name],
- **Formal opening:** Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren,
- **Polite requests:** Könnten Sie bitte... / Ich würde gern...
- **Informal closing:** Viele Grüße / Bis bald
- **Formal closing:** Mit freundlichen Grüßen

### 3. **Speaking Teil 3** (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY!)
**Why:** Collaborative planning is unique to telc format!

**What it is:**
- You and partner plan something together (party, trip, event)
- 6-7 minutes
- Must address 5-6 Leitpunkte from the card
- Must negotiate and reach agreement

**How to practice:**
- Your PDF has practice tasks (page 18)
- Find partner on italki ($10-15/hour) or Tandem app (free)
- Practice making suggestions: "Ich schlage vor..." / "Wie wäre es mit..."
- Practice agreeing: "Gute Idee!" / "Einverstanden!" / "Das finde ich auch."
- Practice disagreeing politely: "Hm, ich bin nicht sicher..." / "Vielleicht lieber..."
- KEY: It's collaborative, NOT a debate! Work together!
